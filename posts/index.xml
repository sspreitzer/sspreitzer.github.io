          A seminar paper I created in 2022 about the problem areas of distance leadership. The paper includes a model for a better understanding for scientists, HR departments and curious leaders.
The results describe that technology is todays transport vehicle of social presence. Trust is influencing added value and prerequisite of innovation. As well as innovation is impeded by control and control mechanisms.

          In 2021 I have written a thesis about the combination of New Work and IT Management in german.
The results describe that companies shall implement normative IT management to connect the work of staff with a purpose in society. Coupled with new work principles such as staff autonomy, staff capabilites and staff inclusion, which excel intrinsic motivation, performance and create an emotional bond with the company.

          This is an idea that is on my mind for quite some time and I struggle to find the software that implements it. And I am not implementing it by myself, for the moment. But maybe this is some challenge for you?
The Idea To create a software that can offer a simple portal to instantiate Terraform modules and manage the state of the instance (CREATE/UPDATE/DELETE). The focus is on allowing novice users to create their own instances of a Terraform module created and maintained by experts.
